### 4. Download the required dependencies

You need to download two files:

- [yt-dlp.exe](https://github.com/yt-dlp/yt-dlp/releases)
- [ffmpeg.exe](https://github.com/yt-dlp/FFmpeg-Builds/releases)  
  _(This will download a .zip with several files ‚Äî you only need `ffmpeg.exe`)_

Once downloaded, move both files to the folder you opened earlier.
